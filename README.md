# Taren't  

Tarballs amalgamate a collection of files into a single file without compression for backups, back when compressing and decompressing files were a costly process. This makes sense for many situations, too, because performing operations on a single file is often faster than doing the same operations on many files.  

However, sometimes, you encounter applications like Discord, with their petty 25MB on a free account.  

That's a scam.  

So, instead, taren't is an application that does precisely the opposite of what .tar files do: Splitting files into multiple parts to be sent simultaneously.
